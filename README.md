# About Model
This model is developed using `Keras` with `Tensorflow 2` as the backend for `Keras`. The model consists of the `120` dog classes and is based on the `MobileNetV2` architecture. This `Keras` model is a fine-tuned version of the `MobileNetV2` model. `MobileNet` architectures are small and are used for deploying on web servers. This Keras model has an accuracy rate of around `98.72 %` on the test set.

# About Dataset
The dataset was taken from Stanford Dogs Dataset!.
Standford Dogs Dataset consists of a photo of 120 different dog breeds. There are roughly 10222 images of dogs in this dataset. As the research suggests the state-of-the-art accuracy for this dataset is `89%`.
